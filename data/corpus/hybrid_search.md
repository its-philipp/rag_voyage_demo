# Hybrid Search

Hybrid search fuses dense semantic results with sparse lexical results (e.g., BM25). Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) is a simple, robust technique to combine rank lists. Benefits:
- Sparse captures exact terms and rare tokens.
- Dense captures paraphrases and semantics.
- Fusion improves robustness across query types.
