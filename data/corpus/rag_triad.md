# RAG Triad Evaluation

The RAG Triad evaluates: (1) Context Relevance (retrieval quality), (2) Groundedness (answer supported by context), and (3) Answer Relevance (final answer addresses the query). Improvements often come from better retrievers (context relevance), citation/attribution prompting (groundedness), and instruction tuning (answer relevance).
