- question: What is ColBERT and how does it compare to cross-encoders?
  answer: 'ColBERT is a retrieval model that balances the expressiveness of computationally
    expensive models, like cross-encoders, with the efficiency of faster models, such
    as bi-encoders. It produces multi-vector embeddings for both queries and documents,
    allowing for deeper, token-level comparisons while maintaining speed. ColBERT
    employs a "late interaction" mechanism, where it computes maximum similarity scores
    between query and document embeddings at search time, summing these scores to
    derive the final query-document score.


    In comparison, cross-encoders jointly process the query and document for deeper,
    token-level comparisons, resulting in higher accuracy but at the cost of speed,
    making them less feasible for searching over large document collections. ColBERT
    offers a middle ground by being faster than cross-encoders while still providing
    more nuanced matching than standard bi-encoders.'

  - This is fast but can lose nuance, as the embedding must compress the entire meaning
    of the text into one vector. On the other hand, cross-encoders (or re-rankers)
    jointly process the query and a document. This allows for deeper, token-level
    comparisons, resulting in much higher accuracy.
  - These maximum scores are then summed up to get the final query-document score.
    This approach is more granular than bi-encoders because it allows for token-level
    matching, but it's much faster than cross-encoders because the expensive joint
    processing is replaced by a simple MaxSim operation. ColBERTv2 further optimizes
    this by pre-computing document embeddings and using a compressed representation
    for the index, making it both fast and memory-efficient.
  - Standard dense retrieval models, often called bi-encoders, independently embed
    the query and the document into single-vector representations. During search,
    they compute a single similarity score (like dot-product or cosine similarity)
    between the query vector and all document vectors. This is fast but can lose nuance,
    as the embedding must compress the entire meaning of the text into one vector.

  - FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library for efficient similarity search
    and clustering of dense vectors. It contains algorithms that search in sets of
    vectors of any size, up to ones that possibly do not fit in RAM. The most basic
    FAISS index is the `IndexFlatL2`.
  - The most basic FAISS index is the `IndexFlatL2`. It performs an exhaustive search,
    computing the L2 distance between the query vector and every other vector in the
    index. This is a brute-force approach and serves as the gold standard for accuracy.
  - This is a brute-force approach and serves as the gold standard for accuracy. However,
    its search time scales linearly with the number of documents, making it slow for
    large datasets. For larger datasets, FAISS offers methods that trade some accuracy
    for speed.
  - '`IndexIVFPQ` is much faster and more memory-efficient because it uses an approximate
    search strategy with partitioning and compression, but the results are not guaranteed
    to be perfect. The trade-off between speed and accuracy is controlled by parameters
    like `nprobe` and the PQ settings.'
  - This allows FAISS to store massive datasets in RAM. In summary, `IndexFlatL2`
    guarantees finding the exact nearest neighbors but is slow. `IndexIVFPQ` is much
    faster and more memory-efficient because it uses an approximate search strategy
    with partitioning and compression, but the results are not guaranteed to be perfect.
  - 'The `nprobe` parameter controls how many cells to visit. A higher `nprobe` means
    better accuracy but slower search. - PQ (Product Quantization): This technique
    compresses the vectors to reduce their memory footprint.'
  - 'This index works by partitioning the vector space into cells (voronoi cells).
    - IVF (Inverted File): At search time, the index only searches within a few cells
    closest to the query vector, rather than the entire dataset. The `nprobe` parameter
    controls how many cells to visit.'

  - 'The RAG framework consists of two main components: a retriever and a generator.
    - The Retriever: Given a user input (e.g., a question), the retriever''s job is
    to find a small set of relevant text passages from the knowledge base. This is
    often implemented using a dense passage retriever (DPR) model, which embeds both
    the input and the passages into a shared high-dimensional vector space for similarity
    search.'
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a methodology for improving the performance
    of Large Language Models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks. It combines a pre-trained
    parametric memory (the LLM itself) with a non-parametric memory, which is typically
    a dense vector index of a large corpus like Wikipedia. The core idea is to retrieve
    relevant documents from the external knowledge source and provide them as context
    to the LLM when generating an answer.
  - 'This is often implemented using a dense passage retriever (DPR) model, which
    embeds both the input and the passages into a shared high-dimensional vector space
    for similarity search. - The Generator: This is a sequence-to-sequence model (like
    BART or T5) that takes the original user input and the retrieved passages as context,
    and generates the final text output. The generator learns to synthesize an answer
    by conditioning on the provided knowledge.'
- question: How does FAISS IVFPQ differ from Flat indexes?
  answer: FAISS IVFPQ (IndexIVFPQ) differs from Flat indexes (like IndexFlatL2) primarily
    in terms of speed and memory efficiency. While IndexFlatL2 guarantees finding
    the exact nearest neighbors through an exhaustive search, making it the gold standard
    for accuracy, it is slow and scales linearly with the number of documents. In
    contrast, IndexIVFPQ uses an approximate search strategy that partitions the vector
    space into cells (voronoi cells) and employs product quantization (PQ) to compress
    vectors, allowing for much faster searches and reduced memory usage. However,
    this speed comes with a trade-off, as the results from IVFPQ are not guaranteed
    to be perfect, and accuracy can be adjusted using parameters like `nprobe`.
