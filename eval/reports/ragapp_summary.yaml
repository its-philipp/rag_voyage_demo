- question: Compare and contrast ColBERT with traditional cross-encoder and bi-encoder
    models, highlighting its unique mechanism.
  answer: 'ColBERT uniquely balances the expressiveness of cross-encoders with the
    efficiency of bi-encoders through its "late interaction" mechanism. Unlike traditional
    cross-encoders, which "jointly encode the [query, document] pair with full attention"
    leading to high computational costs, ColBERT decouples the encoding process. It
    computes MaxSim between query token embeddings and document token embeddings at
    search time, allowing for "faster retrieval while retaining fine-grained matching."


    In contrast, bi-encoders independently embed queries and documents into single-vector
    representations, which can limit their expressiveness. ColBERT''s approach enables
    it to achieve a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between queries
    and documents without the exhaustive computational demands of cross-encoders (doc_id:

  - ColBERTv2 is a retrieval model that balances the expressiveness of computationally
    expensive models with the efficiency of less expressive but faster models. It
    introduces a "late interaction" mechanism over BERT-based embeddings. Standard
    dense retrieval models, often called bi-encoders, independently embed the query
    and the document into single-vector representations.
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a methodology for improving the performance
    of Large Language Models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks. It combines a pre-trained
    parametric memory (the LLM itself) with a non-parametric memory, which is typically
    a dense vector index of a large corpus like Wikipedia. The core idea is to retrieve
    relevant documents from the external knowledge source and provide them as context
    to the LLM when generating an answer.
  - 'Evaluating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application involves assessing
    the quality of both the retrieval and generation components. A useful framework
    for this is the RAG Triad, which focuses on three key metrics: Answer Relevance,
    Context Relevance, and Groundedness. 1.'

  - '# ColBERT Overview


    ColBERT (Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT) is a retrieval model that
    balances the expressiveness of cross-encoders with the efficiency of bi-encoders
    by introducing late interaction. Queries and documents are encoded into token-level
    embeddings. At search time, ColBERT computes MaxSim between each query token embedding
    and document token embeddings, then sums these maxima to produce a score.'
  - Hybrid search is an approach that combines the strengths of traditional keyword-based
    (sparse) search with modern semantic (dense) vector search. This combination provides
    more relevant and accurate results than either method could achieve on its own.
    Sparse retrieval, powered by algorithms like BM25, excels at finding documents
    with exact keyword matches.
  - Dense retrieval is a method used in information retrieval that represents documents
    and queries as dense vectors, known as embeddings. Unlike sparse retrieval methods
    like TF-IDF or BM25, which rely on keyword matching, dense retrieval captures
    the semantic meaning of the text. The process begins with an embedding model,
    often a pre-trained transformer like BERT or a specialized model like Voyage,
    which maps text to a high-dimensional vector space.
  - '# ColBERT vs Cross-Encoders


    Cross-encoders jointly encode the [query, document] pair with full attention,
    enabling deep interactions but at high computational cost. They excel in reranking
    but are infeasible for exhaustive retrieval at scale. ColBERT decouples encoding
    and uses a MaxSim late interaction at query time, yielding faster retrieval while
    retaining fine-grained matching.'
  - '# Reranking Overview


    Rerankers refine candidate lists from fast retrievers. Cross-encoders provide
    strong pairwise scoring but are compute-heavy. ColBERT offers a middle ground
    with token-level late interaction.'
  - '# ColBERT Latency Considerations


    ColBERT incurs per-query encoding and MaxSim computation. To reduce latency: cache
    frequent queries, cap reranker_k, and ensure efficient batching. On GPU, throughput
    improves substantially.'
  - '# Evaluation Methodology


    Use realistic queries and track metrics over time. For RAG triad, keep prompts
    stable. Compare retrieval-only metrics (recall@K, MRR) separately from end-to-end
    metrics.'
  - '# ColBERT vs Bi-Encoders


    Bi-encoders represent queries and documents as single dense vectors, enabling
    fast ANN search but losing token-level nuance. ColBERT uses multiple vectors per
    text and late interaction, improving sensitivity to exact terms and phrasings.
    This typically increases recall and MRR over bi-encoders on passage retrieval
    benchmarks while keeping latency manageable.'

  - '# FAISS Basics


    FAISS provides vector indexes for similarity search. IndexFlatL2 and IndexFlatIP
    perform exact search and serve as accuracy baselines. For large datasets, approximate
    indexes like IVF, HNSW, and PQ reduce latency and memory.'
  - '# Hybrid Search


    Hybrid search fuses dense semantic results with sparse lexical results (e.g.,
    BM25). Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) is a simple, robust technique to combine rank
    lists. Benefits:

    - Sparse captures exact terms and rare tokens.'
- question: How does the FAISS IVFPQ index work, and what are the trade-offs compared
    to a Flat index?
  answer: The FAISS IVFPQ index combines an inverted file (IVF) with product quantization
    (PQ). IVF partitions the space into clusters, allowing queries to probe only the
    nearest clusters, while PQ compresses residual vectors into subvector codebooks.
    This approach reduces memory usage and increases search speed compared to a Flat
    index, which performs exact search and serves as an accuracy baseline. However,
    the trade-off is that IVFPQ may sacrifice some accuracy for improved efficiency,
    particularly in terms of latency and memory usage (doc_id not available).
